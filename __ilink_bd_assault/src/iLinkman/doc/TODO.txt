-Add lock transaction support (?).
-Add isochronous transaction support (?).
-Write a API compatibility module to make this module compatible with SCE's functions (?).
-Add multi-transaction label support(?)
-Verify and fix compatibility with post v8 consoles (Consoles lacking the i.Link hardware).
-Verify the validity of the configuration ROM.
-Come up with a feasible system to determine whether the console contains a valid i.Link port or not.
	It appears that consoles that do not have physical i.Link ports still contain sufficient chip logic to emulate a functional i.Link controller.
-Discover and use the DMAC #3 interrupt entry in INTRMAN.
